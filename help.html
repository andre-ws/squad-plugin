<b>SQUAD</b>
<p>This tool searches through a point file to identify
data anomalies that could indicate data quality issues. Each of these
new columns will be created in the original site file. A &quot;1&quot;
indicates that the anomaly exists. It is possible for a site to have
multiple anomalies identified.</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>Anomaly_1:</b> Missing coordinate.
	<li><b>Anomaly_2:</b> Coordinate is truncated.
	<li><b>Anomaly_3:</b> The point has an identical
	coordinate as another point in the file.
	<li><b>Anomaly_4:</b> The point has an identical
	name as another point in the file.
	<li><b>Anomaly_5:</b> The point is outside of the
	expected administrative unit, but is within two kilometers of the
	expected unit's border.
	<li><b>Anomaly_6:</b> The point is outside of the
	expected administrative unit, and is greater than two kilometers of
	the expected unit's border.
</ul>
